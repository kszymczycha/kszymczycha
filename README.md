# Hi there, I'm Kamil ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate frontend developer and an aspiring UI/UX designer. On a daily basis, I work on creating aesthetic and efficient user interfaces.

## My Skills

- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS (Sass/SCSS), JavaScript (React.js/Next.js/Vue.js)
- **UI/UX Design:** Beginner, but committed to developing skills in interface design.

## Tools and Environment

- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Text Editors:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode), Neovim (configured in Lua)
- **Multiplexer:** Tmux

I primarily use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) in my daily workflow, but I'm actively exploring and expanding my skills in Tmux and Neovim, particularly with a Lua-configured setup.
